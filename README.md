# Semantic NLP Filtering for Deep Learning Papers in Virology/Epidemiology

## Overview
This project aims to filter, classify, and extract relevant information from a dataset of academic papers focused on virology and epidemiology. The dataset, sourced from PubMed, includes papers that might implement deep learning methods. Using semantic natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this script identifies papers applying neural network-based solutions in the targeted fields and classifies them by the type of method used.

## Dataset
The dataset is accessible at the Virology AI Papers Repository and contains 11,450 records in CSV format. Each record represents an academic paper with fields such as title, abstract, and keywords.

## Goals
1. **Filter Papers**: Identify papers that utilize deep learning approaches in virology or epidemiology.
2. **Classify Relevant Papers**: Classify relevant papers into one of four categories: `text mining`, `computer vision`, `both`, or `other`.
3. **Extract Methods**: For each relevant paper, extract and report the name of the deep learning method used.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
