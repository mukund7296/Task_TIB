Here’s a step-by-step approach for implementing this task:

### Step 1: **Set Up the Environment and Import the Dataset**
   - **Set up Python environment**: Create a virtual environment and install necessary libraries, such as `pandas` for data handling and `nltk`, `spacy`, or `transformers` for NLP tasks.
   - **Import the dataset**: Load the CSV file into a DataFrame to inspect and analyze the structure. Identify columns like title, abstract, keywords, and other relevant metadata.

### Step 2: **Text Preprocessing**
   - **Preprocess the text** in relevant columns (e.g., title, abstract):
     - Remove punctuation, convert text to lowercase, and remove stopwords to reduce noise.
     - Tokenize the text if required for semantic filtering.
   - **Optional**: If the dataset contains abstracts, these will be useful for filtering; if not, consider using only the titles.

### Step 3: **Filter Papers Using Semantic NLP Techniques**
   - **Semantic Filtering**: Rather than relying on exact keywords, use a semantic approach to capture relevant papers with a broader meaning.
     - Use pre-trained embeddings (like `spacy`’s word embeddings or sentence transformers) to generate vectors for the terms "deep learning," "neural network," "virology," and "epidemiology."
     - For each paper, calculate cosine similarity between the paper’s text and these terms. Set a similarity threshold to determine relevance.
   - **Heuristics-Based Filtering**:
     - Filter papers using custom rules. For example, include papers with phrases like "deep learning" and "epidemiology" within a close word proximity to improve relevance detection.

### Step 4: **Classify Relevant Papers by Method**
   - For papers deemed relevant (above the similarity threshold), classify the type of method:
     - Check for terms like “text mining,” “computer vision,” or related keywords to classify each paper under `"text mining"`, `"computer vision"`, `"both"`, or `"other"`.
     - Use rules or a lightweight model trained to detect these categories if needed.

### Step 5: **Extract and Record the Deep Learning Method Name**
   - Identify the specific method used by searching for common model names (e.g., CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer) in the title or abstract.
   - Store the extracted method in a new column in the dataset for easy reference.

### Step 6: **Generate a Summary of Dataset Statistics**
   - Calculate and report statistics such as:
     - Total number of relevant papers
     - Counts of each classification type
     - Common methods identified and their frequencies

### Step 7: **Organize the Code and Documentation**
   - **Create a README**: Write a clear README that explains:
     - The goal of the project and its relevance
     - Steps taken in data filtering and classification, including NLP techniques used
     - Why the chosen approach improves over basic keyword filtering
     - Dataset statistics as a summary of the results
   - **Upload to GitHub**: Organize code files, data loading scripts, and the README, and push them to your GitHub repository.
